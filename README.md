# JSHTMLCSSBonanza

This is just gonna be me messing around with HTML/JS/CSS and maybe perhaps React and Angular.

Join me on my journey as I try my best to get some level of competency in this field and finally make a portfolio website.

Be sure to follow me as I complete my portfolio as well! The link to that repo is right here: (I'll add link when its taken shape. Stay tuned)
